# Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

This is SwiftKey (http://swiftkey.com/en/) Capstone project of Data Science Specialization.

The goal of this project intends to:
1- Display ability to wotk with the data and to create a prediction algorithm through explaining used exploratory analysis and goals for the eventual app and algorithm. 
2- This document should be concise and explain only the major features of the data identified and briefly summarize plans for creating the prediction algorithm and Shiny app in a way that would be understandable to a non-data scientist manager. 
3- it is required to make use of tables and plots to illustrate important summaries of the data set.
